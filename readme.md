We have 

    | externs.h
    | gencode.h
    | reg_stack.h
    | symbol.h
    | tree.h

as declaring the interfaces for functions, classes, or other entities without providing their implementations. This allows us to use these entities without needing to know the implementation details.(Hiding the each function details).


To run the assignment use the following command :

    | ./compiler input.txt

This is the demo file1 to change another input we can run :

    | ./compiler input2.txt
